Utilizing Nim For Both Offensive and Defensive Operations.

## Motives
I have been experimenting with **Nim** for a few months now, And I have decided to make a repository where i will share what i have learnt using nim for both *offensive* and *defensive* operations, This repository is still in very early stages of development, And I have only released helper functions / programs under the [General](https://github.com/dk0m/NeutralNim/blob/main/General/) folder of this repository, In the upcoming days, I will start releasing helpful guides and code to help with certain goals both for the offensive and defensive part.
